# Deep-Learning-Volatility


The paper realase by Blanka Horvath; Aitor Muguruza and Mehdi Tomas is sujesting to use deep learning as a speed up for pricing.
Neural networks efficiently approximate complex pricing functions offline, addressing calibration challenges in models with slow pricing. 

In this repo we implement the paper with a c++ library to speed up the online pricing and we put the off-line learning phase in a time-laps 
in order to visualise it.
We present a graph with the calibration duration.
