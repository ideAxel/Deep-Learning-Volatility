# Deep-Learning-Volatility


The academic paper realased by Blanka Horvath; Aitor Muguruza and Mehdi Tomas suggests to use deep learning as a speed up for pricing.

By learning the model from model parameters to expected payoff, we can relocate the time-consuming part of calibration, which is the functional evaluation
of prices, to an offline pre-processing of the data. For the on-line calibration part, we are only calibrating a deterministic function, which is fast. 

Neural networks efficiently approximate complex pricing functions offline, addressing calibration challenges in models with slow pricing. 
Such as Rough Volatility models like the rBergomi model.

In this repo we implement the paper with a c++ library to speed up the online pricing and we put the off-line learning phase in a time-laps 
in order to visualise it.
We present a graph with the calibration duration.
