# Deep-Learning-Volatility


The paper realase by Blanka Horvath; Aitor Muguruza and Mehdi Tomas is sujesting to use deep learning as a speed up for pricing.

In this repo we implement the paper with a c++ library to speed up the online pricing and we put the off-line learning phase in a time-laps 
in order to visualise it.

we present a graph with the calibration duration. 



# In this repo you will find : 

-The main file  
-The c++ file with the hardcoding of the Neural Net and the gradient  
-The compilation output to use the code esealy   
-The config file for the c++ compilation if needed
